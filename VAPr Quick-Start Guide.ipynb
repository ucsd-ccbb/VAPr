    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the basic steps of how variants coming from a VCF file can be annotated efficiently and thoroughly using the package VAPr. VAPr provides a way of retrieving variant information using [ANNOVAR](http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/) and/or [myvariant.info](myvariant.info) through Python calls and consolidating it in conveninent formats. It is well-suited for bioinformaticians interested in aggregating variant information for ease of use and to provide higher analysis capabities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more complete description of the functionalities of the package, you can visit the [VAPr Sample Usage Notebook](https://github.com/ucsd-ccbb/VAPr/blob/master/VAPr%20Sample%20Usage.ipynb) and/or check the full documentation on GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note to reviewers*: this notebook is in all its functionalities the same as the one in the official documentation (https://github.com/ucsd-ccbb/VAPr/blob/master/VAPr%20Quick-Start%20Guide.ipynb). We have added some notes here regarding performance and regarding the file structure of this instance."

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "VAPr requires a Python 3 environment with the pandas library and MongoDB installed.  Here, we provide instructions for how to set up such an environment using  `conda`, a cross-platform package and environment manager.  (If you wish to follow this approach but do not already have either the full or minimal version of `conda` (`Anaconda` or `miniconda`, respectively) installed on your system, visit [https://conda.io/docs/get-started.html](https://conda.io/docs/get-started.html) to decide which is right for you and then follow the instructions provided there to install it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3 and MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "VAPr is written in Python 3, and stores variant annotations in NoSQL database, using a locally-installed instance of MongoDB.  If you wish to run the Jupyter notebooks provided with VAPr locally, it is also necessary to have a local Jupyter notebook server installed. To set up these requirements in your machine's default environment using `conda`, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install python=3 pandas mongodb pymongo jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB also needs a location to store its data, so create a directory for this in the location of your choice, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mkdir -p /Temp/MongoDbData\n",
    "    \n",
    "(or, on Windows systems, `md /Temp/MongoDbData`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then start the MongoDb with the command\n",
    "\n",
    "    mongod --dbpath /Temp/MongoDbData\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "To check if mongodb is currently running, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    service mongod status\n",
    "    \n",
    "which should return    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    mongod (pid 591) is running...\n",
    "    \n",
    "519 is the process number so it may differ every time it is run. In case it is not running, the comand will return:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mongod dead but subsys locked\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### VAPr\n",
    "\n",
    "VAPr is available from PyPi.  Once the above requirements have been installed, VAPr itself can be installed by just running:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install VAPr\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANNOVAR\n",
    "(It is possible to proceed without installing ANNOVAR. In that case, the variants that will be annotated and sent ot Mongo are the ones found in MyVariant.info. In that case, users can skip the next steps and go straight to the section **Known Variant Annotation and Storage**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Users who wish to annotate novel variants will also need to have a local installation of the popular command-line software ANNOVAR([1](#Citations)), which VAPr wraps with a Python interface.  If you use ANNOVAR's functionality through VAPr, please remember to cite the ANNOVAR publication (see #1 in [Citations](#Citations))!\n",
    "\n",
    "The base ANNOVAR program must be installed by each user individually, since its license agreement does not permit redistribution.  Please visit the ANNOVAR download form at [http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/annovar_download_form.php](http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/annovar_download_form.php), ensure that you meet the requirements for a free license, and fill out the required form.  You will then receive an email providing a link to the latest ANNOVAR release file.  Download this file (which will usually have a name like `annovar.latest.tar.gz`) and place it in the location on your machine in which you would like the ANNOVAR program and its data to be installed--the entire disk size of the databases will be around 25 GB, so make sure you have such space available!  Record the complete path to this location in the `ANNOVAR_PATH` variable below so that VAPr will know where to access it:\n"

If additional annotations should be included--such as those generated by ANNOVAR for novel variants--these can be provided as a CSV-formatted file.  \n",

    "A great introduction to the concepts relevant to MongoDB, and specifically how to interact with it using python can be found [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/python/introduction/). Of particular interest is the explanation on how documents are formatted and stored inside a the database. Variants will follow that format as well: a sample entry of the database will look roughly as follows (the document for this variant (HGVS_id: chr20:g.25194768A>G) has been reduced to half of its actual size). \n",
